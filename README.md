# STM32F407 with TFT LCD and MQTT

The two projects in this repository illustrate how one could design a standalone product using an STM32F407 Discovery Kit. The documents, `STM32F407 Discovery Kit with TFT LCD Display.pdf` and `STM32F407 Discovery Kit with ESP32 and MQTT.pdf` provide detailed instructions for their respective projects.

The `tft_lcd` project connects the STM32F407 with a touchscreen display and demonstrates communication back and forth between them. The `tft_lcd_mqtt` project expands on this to incorporate wireless communicaton via the MQTT protocol, commonly used in Internet of Things (IoT) applications.

Completed code for each project can be found in its corresponding folder, which each contain a complete STM32 project.
